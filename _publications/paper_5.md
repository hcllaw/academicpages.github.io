title: 'Hyperparameter Learning via Distributional Transfer'
collection: publications
authors: '**H. Law**, P. Zhao, J. Huang, D. Sejdinovic'
excerpt: 'Bayesian optimisation is a popular technique for hyperparameter learning 
but typically requires initial exploration even in cases where potentially similar prior
tasks have been solved. We propose to transfer information across tasks using
kernel embeddings of distributions of training datasets used in those tasks. The
resulting method has a faster convergence compared to existing baselines, in some
cases requiring only a few evaluations of the target objective.'
