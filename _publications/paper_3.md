excerpt: 'We construct an approach to learning from aggregation of outputs based on variational learning with Gaussian processes. In particular, 
we propose new bounds and tractable approximations, leading to improved prediction accuracy and scalability to large datasets, 
while explicitly taking uncertainty into account. We apply our framework to a challenging and important problem, 
the fine-scale spatial modelling of malaria incidence, with over 1 million observations.'
