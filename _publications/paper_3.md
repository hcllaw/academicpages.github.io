title: "A Differentially Private Kernel Two-Sample Test"
collection: publications
authors: "A. Raj*, **H. Law***, D. Sejdinovic, M. Park "
excerpt: 'Kernel two-sample testing is a useful statistical tool in determining whether data samples arise from different 
distributions without imposing any parametric assumptions on those distributions. However, raw data samples can expose 
ensitive information about individuals who participate in scientific studies, which makes the current tests vulnerable 
to privacy breaches. Hence, we design a new framework for kernel two-sample testing conforming to differential privacy constraints, 
in order to guarantee the privacy of subjects in the data.'
