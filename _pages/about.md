I am a final year PhD student in Machine Learning at the University of Oxford supervised by Professor Dino Sejdinovic and Dr Christopher Yau.

My research interests lie in the field of kernel methods, Gaussian processes, transfer learning, deep learning and most recently Bayesian optimisation. In particular, I am interested in how these approaches can be applied onto real life problems.
