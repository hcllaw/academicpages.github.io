I am a second year PhD student of Machine Learning group at the University of Oxford supervised by Professor Dino Sejdinovic and Dr Christopher Yau. 

My research interests lies in the field of kernel methods, Gaussian processes and deep learning. In particular, I am interested in how these approaches can be combined and applied onto real life problems. 

Currently, I am working on a project on aggregate output learning, where we have the scenario that we only have label summaries for bags of data, but we would like to predict labels at the individual level.
