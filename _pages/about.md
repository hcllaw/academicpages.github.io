I am second year PhD student in the OxWaSP CDT programe at the University of Oxford supervised by Professor Dino Sejdinovic and Dr Christopher Yau. My research interests lies in the field of machine learning, kernel methods, Gaussian Process and deep learning. Currently, I am working on a project on aggregate output learning and learning from label proportions.
